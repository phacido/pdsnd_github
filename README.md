### Udacity Project 2: Bikeshare

### Description
This project has to allow the user to see statistics for bike trips in three different cities: new york, chicago and washington.

The script bikeshare.py receives input from the user, like the city, the day of the week and month that they want to get information from and then read the corresponding .csv files.

The script should return information like most popular origin and end stations, mean travel time and available demographic information from users.

### Files used
